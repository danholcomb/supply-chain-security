DigitalSignature.cpp uses DSA algorithm to sign package fingerprints during enrollment phase of counterfoil, 
and verify signature during the verification phase of counterfoil. The program uses Crypto++ library (v8.2.0)
for implementation of DSA.

SETUP
  1. Download Crypto++ from Git ( https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp )
  2. Copy DigitalSignature.cpp to cryptopp/
  3. Edit GNUmake file to compile DigitalSignature.cpp rather than the default test.cpp
  4. Run "make" to generate the executable cryptest.exe
