# Algorithm 1

The script assumes that abc has been installed on your system and can be executed from the command line. abc can be installed from its [official repository](https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc). Once installed, add the abc executable to your PATH variable. Executing abc from your command line should give you something like this:

```
$ abc
UC Berkeley, ABC 1.01 (compiled Feb 16 2021 18:57:37)
abc 01> 
```

Execute `alg1.py` with the help option to see the required inputs 

```
$ ./alg1.py --help
```
